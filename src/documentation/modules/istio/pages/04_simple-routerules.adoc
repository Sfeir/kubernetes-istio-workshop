= Simple Route Rules
include::_attributes.adoc[]

This section demonstrates how to use various traffic management capabilities of Istio.

We will show you how to route requests dynamically to multiple versions of a microservice.

== Deploy recommendation:v2

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/kubernetes/recommendation-v2.yml
----

Wait for those pods to show "2/2", the istio-proxy/envoy sidecar is part of that pod

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customer-3600192384-fpljb            2/2       Running   0          17m
preference-243057078-8c5hz           2/2       Running   0          15m
recommendation-v1-60483540-9snd9     2/2       Running   0          12m
recommendation-v2-2815683430-vpx4p   2/2       Running   0          15s
----

and test the customer endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
curl $customer
----

you would likely see ``"customer =&gt; preference =&gt; recommendation v1 from '99634814-d2z2t': 3"``, where '99634814-d2z2t' is the pod running ``v1`` and the ``3`` is basically the number of times you hit the endpoint.

Run again the command:
[source]
----
curl $customer
----

you would likely see ``"customer =&gt; preference =&gt; recommendation v2 from '2819441432-5v22s': 1"`` as by default you get round-robin load-balancing when there is more than one Pod behind a Service

Send several requests to see their responses:

[source, bash]
----
while true; do curl $customer; sleep .5; done
----

The default Kubernetes behavior is to round-robin load-balance across all available pods behind a single Service. Add another replica of recommendation-v2 Deployment.

image:k8s-istio-k8s-istio-4-simple-scale-v2.png[]

[source,bash]
----
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment/recommendation-v2
----

Now, you will see two requests into the v2 and one for v1.

[source,bash]
----
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '2819441432-qsp25': 29
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '99634814-sf4cl': 37
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '99634814-xq3c5': 38
----

Scale back to a single replica of the recommendation-v2 Deployment

[source,bash]
----
kubectl scale --replicas=1 deployment/recommendation-v2
----

[#istiorouting]
== Changing Istio Routings

Before you can use Istio to control version routing, you need to define the available versions, called _subsets_, in https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/istio.networking.v1alpha3/#DestinationRule[DestinationRule].

[source,yaml]
----
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  host: recommendation
  subsets:
  - name: version-v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: version-v2
    labels:
      version: v2
----

Run the following command to create default destination rules to send traffic to versions ``v1`` and ``v2`` of recommandation service.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/routing-simple/recommendation-destination-rule-v1-v2.yml
----

Wait a few seconds for the destination rules to propagate.

You can display the created destination rule with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get destinationrules recommendation -o yaml
----

To display all destination rules :

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get destinationrules -o yaml
----

[#alltorecommendationv2]
=== Route all the traffic to recommendation:v2

To route to one version only, you apply virtual services that set the default version for the microservices. In this case, the virtual services will route all traffic to v2 of recommendation microservice.

image:k8s-istio-4-simple-routing-all-v2.png[]

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v2
      weight: 100
----

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/routing-simple/recommendation-virtual-service-v2.yml

curl $customer
----

you should only see v2 being returned

[#alltorecommendationv1]
=== Route all the traffic to recommendation:v1

image:k8s-istio-4-simple-routing-all-v1.png[]

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/routing-simple/recommendation-virtual-service-v1.yml
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v1
----

[#alltorecommendationv1v2]
=== Route the traffic to both versions of recommendation: v1 and v2

By simply removing the virtual service

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete virtualservice recommendation
----

and you should see the default behavior of load-balancing between v1 and v2

[source,bash]
----
curl $customer
----

[#canarydeploymentrecommendation]
=== Canary deployment: Split traffic between v1 and v2

Canary Deployment scenario: push v2 into the cluster but slowly send end-user traffic to it, if you continue to see success, continue shifting more traffic over time

image:k8s-istio-4-simple-routing-split-90-10.png[]

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -l app=recommendation

NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
recommendation-v1-3719512284-7mlzw   2/2       Running   6          2h
recommendation-v2-2815683430-vn77w   2/2       Running   0          1h
----

Create the `virtualservice` that will send 90% of requests to v1 and 10% to v2

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/routing-simple/recommendation-virtual-service-v1_and_v2.yml
----

[source,yaml]
----
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v2
      weight: 10
----

and send in several requests:

[source, bash]
----
while true; do curl $customer; sleep .5; done
----

In another terminal, change the mixture to be 75/25

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/routing-simple/recommendation-virtual-service-v1_and_v2_75_25.yml
----

=== Clean up

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete virtualservice recommendation

kubectl delete destinationrule recommendation
----
