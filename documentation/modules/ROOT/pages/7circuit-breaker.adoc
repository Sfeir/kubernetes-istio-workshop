[#failfast]
== Fail Fast with Max Connections and Max Pending Requests

For this scenario, we will equally split the traffic between recommendation v1 and v2 :

.Virtual Service
[source,yaml]
----
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v1
      weight: 50
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: version-v2
      weight: 50
----

kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/routing-simple/recommendation-destination-rule-v1-v2.yml

kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/circuit-breaker/fail-fast/recommendation-virtual-service-v1_and_v2_50_50.yml
----

[#nocircuitbreaker]
=== Load test without circuit breaker

Let's perform a load test in our system with `siege`. We'll have 20 clients sending 2 concurrent requests each:

[source,bash]
----
docker run lonelyplanet/siege siege -r 2 -c 20 -v $CUSTOMER_URL
----

You should see an output similar to this:

image:siege_ok.png[siege output with all successful requests]

CAUTION: All of the requests to our system were successful, *but it took some time to run the test, as the `v2` instance was a slow performer*.

[#circuitbreaker]
=== Load test with circuit breaker

Suppose that in a production system this 3s delay was caused by too many concurrent requests to the same instance. We don't want multiple requests getting queued or making the instance even slower. So we'll add a circuit breaker that will *open* whenever we have more than 1 request being handled by any instance.

[source,bash]

kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/circuit-breaker/fail-fast/recommendation-destination-rule-cb_policy_version.yml

.Destination Rule

----

More information on the fields for the simple https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/istio.routing.v1alpha1.html#CircuitBreaker.SimpleCircuitBreakerPolicy[circuit-breaker]

Now let's see what is the behavior of the system running `siege` again:

[source,bash]
----
docker run lonelyplanet/siege siege -r 2 -c 20 -v $CUSTOMER_URL
----

image:siege_cb_503.png[siege output with some 503 requests due to open circuit breaker]

You can run siege multiple times, but in all of the executions you should see some `503` errors being displayed in the results. That's the circuit breaker being opened whenever Istio detects more than 1 pending request being handled by the instance.

Clean up

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f manifests/istio/circuit-breaker/fail-fast/recommendation-destination-rule-cb_policy_version.yml

kubectl delete -f manifests/istio/circuit-breaker/fail-fast/recommendation-virtual-service-v1_and_v2_50_50.yml
----

[#poolejection]
== Pool Ejection

Pool ejection or _outlier detection_ is a resilience strategy that takes place whenever we have a pool of instances/pods to serve a client request. If the request is forwarded to a certain instance and it fails (e.g. returns a 50x error code), then Istio will eject this instance from the pool for a certain _sleep window_. In our example the sleep window is configured to be 15s. This increases the overall availability by making sure that only healthy pods participate in the pool of instances.

First, you need to insure you have a `destinationrule` and `virtualservice` in place to send traffic to the services. Let's use a 50/50 split of traffic:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/routing-simple/recommendation-destination-rule-v1-v2.yml

kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/circuit-breaker/fail-fast/recommendation-virtual-service-v1_and_v2_50_50.yml
----

Scale number of instances of `v2` deployment

[source,bash]
----
kubectl scale deployment recommendation-v2 --replicas=2 -n tutorial
----

Wait for all the pods to be in the ready state.

[#nofailinginstances]
=== Test behavior without failing instances

Throw some requests at the customer endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
while true; do curl $CUSTOMER_URL; sleep .5; done
----

You will see the load balancing 50/50 between the two different versions of the `recommendation` service. And within version `v2`, you will also see that some requests are handled by one pod and some requests are handled by the other pod.

[source,bash]
----
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '2039379827-jmm6x': 447

----

[#failinginstancesnopoolejection]
=== Test behavior with failing instance and without pool ejection

Let's get the name of the pods from recommendation `v2`:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -l app=recommendation,version=v2
----

You should see something like this:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
recommendation-v2-777598bdc4-d97p7   2/2       Running   0          2m
recommendation-v2-777598bdc4-kr7rt   2/2       Running   0          51m
----

Now we'll get into one the pods and add some erratic behavior on it. Get one of the pod names from your system and replace on the following command accordingly:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods|grep recommendation-v2|awk '{ print $1 }'|head -1) -c recommendation -- curl 127.0.0.1:8080/misbehave

Output:  Following requests to '/' will return a 503
----

This is a special endpoint that will make our application return only ``503``s.

Throw some requests at the customer endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
while true; do curl $CUSTOMER_URL; sleep .5; done
----

You'll see that whenever the pod `recommendation-v2-2036617847-spdrb` receives a request, you get a `503` error:

[source,bash]

customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '2039379827-jmm6x': 494

[#failinginstancespoolejection]
=== Test behavior with failing instance and with pool ejection

Now let's add the pool ejection behavior:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: DestinationRule
...
spec:
  host: recommendation
  subsets:
  ...
  - labels:
      version: v2
    name: version-v2

      connectionPool:
        http: {}
        tcp: {}
      loadBalancer:
        simple: RANDOM
      outlierDetection:
        baseEjectionTime: 15.000s
        consecutiveErrors: 1
        interval: 5.000s
        maxEjectionPercent: 100
----

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio/circuit-breaker/pool-ejection/recommendation-destination-rule-cb_policy_pool_ejection.yml
----

Throw some requests at the customer endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
while true; do curl $CUSTOMER_URL; sleep .5; done
----

You will see that whenever you get a failing request with `503` from the pod `recommendation-v2-2036617847-spdrb`, it gets ejected from the pool, and it doesn't receive any more requests until the sleep window expires - which takes at least 15s.

[#circuitbreakerandpoolejection]
== Ultimate resilience with retries, circuit breaker, and pool ejection

Even with pool ejection your application doesn't _look_ that resilient. That's probably because we're still letting some errors to be propagated to our clients. But we can improve this. If we have enough instances and/or versions of a specific service running into our system, we can combine multiple Istio capabilities to achieve the ultimate backend resilience:
- *Circuit Breaker* to avoid multiple concurrent requests to an instance;
- *Pool Ejection* to remove failing instances from the pool of responding instances;
- *Retries* to forward the request to another instance just in case we get an open circuit breaker and/or pool ejection;

By simply adding a *retry* configuration to our current `virtualservice`, we'll be able to get rid completely of our ``503``s requests. This means that whenever we receive a failed request from an ejected instance, Istio will forward the request to another supposably healthy instance.

[source,bash]
